## Description
De Drum Room is a website I made for a client. It has a very simple design, and originally had made use of a cart system. This was changed when the clients need changed, yet the code is still there to be used if need be.

## Installation
If you clone the repo you must npm install in the root directory. Otherwise visit the site at https://www.dedrumroom.com
